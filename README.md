## How to use it

Go to a folder of your choosing and clone this repository via terminal with <br>
`git clone https://github.com/ianisout/mockup-entrysearch .`<br>
<sub> The dot will make sure that you're cloning it directly into the chosen folder and not create a subfolder.</sub>

Run<br>
`npm install`<br><br>
Wait for until all dependencies are updated, then run<br>
`npx nodemon`<br>

Your project should be up and running, access it on the url<br>
`http://localhost:3000/`<br><br>
You don't have access it on your browser for the testing to work on the other project.

<hr>

There's currently one user created for the testing:<br>
Username: `test@test.test`<br>
Password: `test@test.test`<br><br>
NOTE: Other users can be created, but the search won't work unless you change the log in credentials on the <a href="https://github.com/ianisout/search-automation-xlsx#inner-workings">other project's script</a>.<br>
